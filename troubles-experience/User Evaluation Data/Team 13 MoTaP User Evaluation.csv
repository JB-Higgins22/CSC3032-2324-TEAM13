Perhaps if there was a marker to show which decisions you'd already picked that would make the process even more straightforward to carry out.","5","The visuals and overall layout were pretty good. The word board at the end is a great idea.","5","It quite clearly outlined how difficult it was to please both sides in the peace process","5","There didn't appear to be any bias to either side in the system. The concerns and voices of both sides at the peace conference appear to have been accounted for."

Transitions between slides of text and the animation of the scales updating upon each answer were really well done and gave it a professional feel.","1","The instructions laid out prior to the puzzle were clear and comprehensive, with helpful example images.","1","","4","It would be helpful to have a button to go backwards during the explanation of how to work the puzzle, just in case someone wanted to re-read the steps for clarification.","4","I feel like the text outside of the puzzle would be clearer and easier to read if it wasn't stretched across the entire screen. It would be better if it was a little more condensed in the middle.","5","This was reinforced by the use of the scales and how they were dynamic. It made it clear how hard it was to propose solutions to issues while also achieving a balance between the two communities.","5","I felt that in the puzzle itself, the options for each issue were not obvious in which direction they would sway the scales, which was really interesting. This gave the puzzle more purpose as I felt that the answers weren't set out in a way that you could purposely sway the scales one way or another; I was making my choices before being able to reflect on how my answer tipped the balance."
