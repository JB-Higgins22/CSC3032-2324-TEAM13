------------------- ORIGINAL RESEARCH ------------------- :
Enabling Devolution of Powers from Westminster to Stormont –  

Key requirements: 

Freeing of those arrested. (DUP walked out over this issue due to lack of weapons decommissioning.) 

Power sharing implementation. 

Petition of Concern. – like above 

Armed groups agreed to dispose of their weapons. (Related to first issue.) 

Scaling back of military presence. 

Right to self-determination regarding a united Ireland.  

Dual nationality. (unlikely to have much against it) 

Succession of the RUC with the PSNI, including the supervisory Board. 

Establishment of the north south relationship and the East West relationships respectively. 

-- Release of prisoners --

Overview 

There are currently hundreds in prison who have been arrested for involvement in paramilitary activities, most of these prisoners are seen as having ties to republican groups, however there are others seen as being part of loyalist militant groups. There is a decision to be made on whether to release these prisoners as part of the peace process. 

For  

This would greatly increase support, mainly from Republican groups who feel that many of the captives are innocent and wrongly arrested, although some on both sides are in favour or at least willing to allow the release of prisoners as a part of a peace deal. It is likely paramilitary groups will be more likely to join in peace talks if this agreement is made. 

Against 

The DUP feel that the release would be unjust for the families of the victims who are seeking justice. 

It is unlikely the DUP will remain in talks if any paramilitary parties take part as these groups have not begun decommissioning their weaponry. 

Options: 

BEST - Begin the release conflict prisoners. 

WORST - Do not release conflict prisoners. 

 

Between 1998 and 2012 506 prisoners were granted early release. 

Over 500 prisoners from both loyalist and nationalist groups will be released from prison in the years after the agreement.

-- Paramilitary Weapons Decomissioning --

Overview 

There are calls for a procedure to be put in place that would see the paramilitaries surrendering all weaponry, doing so would help signify an end to the violence of the troubles and allow paramilitary groups demonstrate their willingness to work toward peace. 

For: Most people are in favour of this occurring. The main issues raised are with how the decommissioning would be implemented.  

Against: Fringe parts of the paramilitary groups will be hesitant to give up their arms in case peace talks fail and hostilities resumed.   


Options: 

OK - Put Decomissioning into place immediately using the RUC to enforce it. 

Best - Install a commission that would oversee the decommissioning of weaponry with paramilitary groups co-operation.  

WORST - Do not put measures in place to bring about decommission.   

 

NOTES: 

During the process of decommissioning the Democratic Unionist Party demanded that the IRA release photographs of the decommissioning process in order to satisfy the unionist "man in the street". The IRA rejected these claims, claiming it would amount to "humiliation", and that two clergymen would oversee the process instead. 

UVF and RHC forces would not decommission their weapons until 2007, fearing following in the IRAs footsteps would be “dancing to their tune”.

-- Normalisation of NI and Scaling back of Military Presence --

Overview 

As part of the peace process, military presence in Northern Ireland could be reduced to normal levels. This would mean the reduction of military installations in the state and a reduction in troops deployed.  This process has already begun with the numbers of both trending downward in line with peace talks. 

 

For 

Nationalist groups see demilitarisation as the key allowing day to day life in Northern Ireland return to normal. 

 

  

Against 

Both the DUP and the UUP parties see the scaling back of the military presence as premature. 

 

Options 

BAD - Fully withdraw troops immediately. 

WORST - Maintain Full military presence in Northern Ireland for the foreseeable. 

BEST - Put plans in place to start demobilisation of the British military as part of the peace process. 



-- Changes to Policing in Northern Ireland --

Overview 

A very controversial part of the peace negotiations revolves around whether to implement changes to policing in Northern Ireland.  The current police force – the RUC or Royal Ulster Constabulary has existed since 1922 and it had been involved in various scandals since the beginning of the troubles. Some still feel however that the RUC is more than capable of returning to a demilitarised state from which it could adequately serve the citizens of Northern Ireland. 

For 

Many Catholic residents in NI feel that the RUC is a Protestant organisation. For the police force to be able to work with the entire nation moving forward, it is felt that changes must be made. 

Against 

Others feel that the RUC is sufficient to continue as a civilian police force.  

Options 

GOOD – Replace the current Police Forces; the RUC; with a police force made up of an equal representation of Catholic and Protestant officers. 

BEST - implement an independent commission to oversee an inquiry into policing in Northern Ireland.  

WORST – Do not implement any changes to policing in Northern Ireland. 



-- Power Sharing Implementation --

Overview 

In order to encourage cross community co-operation, plans are to be put in place to facilitate power-sharing within the main system of governance. This new system will act as a devolved government for those in Northern Ireland. There is a major decision to be made on if additional measures will be taken to ensure fair representation.  

 

For 

Both Unionists and nationalists favour a power sharing structure as they feel it is the best way to handle the complex political situation in Northern Ireland.  

 

 

Against 

Some groups argue that this approach is not true democracy and would allow a minority too much power over the majority. 

 

Options 

GOOD – Implementation of a Power-sharing coalition rule to ensure fair representation of both Unionist and Nationalists.  

BAD – Implement the same system of government used by the United Kingdom. 


-- Petition of Concern --

Overview 

Due to the Unionist majority in terms of population in Northern Ireland, another proposal has been put forward. It would entail an additional rule that would allow a minority party to designate any issue a cross-community issue, requiring that a bill must be decided for by a majority of both Unionist and Nationalist votes. 

 

For 

Some see this rule as key to allowing the sharing of power between unionist and Nationalist groups, preventing one group from simply outvoting the other on key issues. 

Against 

Some see this rule as troublesome and anti-democratic. It is felt that this rule may allow a minority of the government to hold the majority to ransom and essentially enable the vetoing of bills that would otherwise pass. 

 

Options 

GOOD – Implementation of a petition of concern requiring members of two separate parties to submit it.   

BAD – Do not implement the petition of concern. 

https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/2/section/6 




-- Right to Self Determination -- 

Overview 

A key part of the peace talks entails the contents of an agreement between the British and Irish governments. This discussion revolves around whether Northern Ireland will remain a part of the UK now and in the future. 

For 

Nationalists are strongly in favour of allowing the citizens of Northern Ireland a vote on becoming a United Ireland. They feel that a non-violent path to a united island is the correct way forward. 

 

Against 

Unionists strongly oppose any legislature that would allow a referendum on Northern Irelands status as part of the United Kingdom. 

 

Options 

Good – Put forward legislature that will reserve the right of the people of Northern Ireland to have a choice to agree to a united Ireland. They also have the choice to stay a part of the United Kingdom. 

Bad – Put forward legislature that will keep Northern Ireland as a permanent state of the United Kingdom. 

Bad – put forward legislature that will hand over control of Northern Ireland to the Irish Government.
